# Agent_LangChain_OpenAI

This repository demonstrates how to develop intelligent agents using LangChain and OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo. The agent is capable of performing various tasks, including:

Web Search: Using the DuckDuckGo search tool for retrieving up-to-date information.

Weather Queries: Integrating OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data.

Natural Language Understanding: Utilizing OpenAI's ChatGPT for processing and generating responses.

Custom Tooling: Implementing a word count tool to analyze text length.

Features

✅ Uses LangChain's ReAct Agent for reasoning and tool invocation

✅ Integrates multiple external APIs (DuckDuckGo, OpenWeatherMap)

✅ Implements a custom word count function as an additional tool

✅ Provides a structured framework for extending functionality


#Usage

Set your OpenAI and OpenWeatherMap API keys.

Initialize the agent and tools.

Invoke the agent with queries such as:
"What's the weather in Colombo?"

#Future Enhancements

Support for more LLM models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Mistral)

Enhanced error handling and logging

More custom tools for expanded functionality
